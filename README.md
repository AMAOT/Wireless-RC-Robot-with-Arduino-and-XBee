Example code using the wireless remote controller (SAMD21) to control the SparkFun RedBot (ATmega328P) via XBee. A character is pipelined between two serial UARTs using a pair of XBee Series 1 Transcievers. Make sure to use software serial example code for the RedBot to avoid bricking your XBee. This expands on SparkFun Inventor's Kit for RedBot.
